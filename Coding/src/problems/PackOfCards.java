/**
 * U have a pack of cards. Each one is a plain card with a number on it. They are all shuffled. U r provided with an algorithm move(int cardNo). This method will pick the card (u passed as param) and put it at the top of all cards. i.e, push back all cards one step down and make ur card at the top. Write an algorithm to sort all the cards so that No 1 is at the top and say No.52 is at the bottom. Your algorithm should order it in minimum number of moves. Use the method move(cardNo) in your code.
 Solution time complexity should be O(n). Assume move(cardNo) as O(1).

 Eg :[ 3 4 2 1 5 ] - ur move shd be to move 2 first and then 1. - No. of moves - 2 . Result : [ 1 2 3 4 5]
 [ 1 2 4 5 3 ] - No. of moves - 3
